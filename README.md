### How to produce solutions:

I put all relevant files wich are needed to produce the output either
to the /src or /test/files_for_testing direcotry. Following files are needed to produce output:

In /src directory:
- Aligned.out.sam (Output from STAR, for Exercise 2.2)
- genomefasta.sec (For Exercise 1.4)
- sequencesfasta.sec (Also for Exercise 1.4)

In /test/files_for_testing directory (Manipulated files for testing):
- sam_test.sam 
- genomefasta_test.sec 
- sequencesfasta_test.sec 

Now, to generate output simply run execute_tasks.py in the /src folder.
